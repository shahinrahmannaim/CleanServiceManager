# Set Up CI/CD Pipeline from Replit

## Current Status
Your project is set up for CI/CD with:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
- ✅ DigitalOcean deployment specification ready
- ✅ All deployment configurations in place

## Step 1: Sync Current Code to GitHub

### Using Replit's Version Control
1. **Look for Git/Version Control panel** in your Replit sidebar
2. **If available:** Use "Push to GitHub" or "Sync" button
3. **If not available:** Follow manual method below

### Manual GitHub Update Method
Since git commands have restrictions:

1. **Download Project:**
   - Three dots menu (⋮) → "Download as zip"
   - Extract all files

2. **Update GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/shahinrahmannaim/CleanServiceManager
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Upload ALL extracted files (including new CI/CD files)
   - Commit message: "Add CI/CD pipeline and deployment configurations"

## Step 2: Configure DigitalOcean App Platform

1. **Create App:**
   - Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
   - Click "Create App"
   - Connect to GitHub: `shahinrahmannaim/CleanServiceManager`

2. **Enable Auto-Deploy:**
   - Branch: `main`
   - ✅ "Autodeploy on push" (enables CI/CD)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`

3. **Import Configuration:**
   - Use `app-platform-spec.yaml` from your repository
   - Or manually add environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=7aLLoc7Apiu3HETpnm5bniajafHKEZNwztXIaEWRHbM=
   SUPERADMIN_EMAIL=admin@panaroma.qa
   SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD=SuperAdmin123!@#
   ```

4. **Add Database:**
   - PostgreSQL component
   - Plan: Basic ($15/month)

## Step 3: Test CI/CD Pipeline

Once set up:
1. **Make change in Replit** (edit any file)
2. **Push to GitHub** (via Git panel or manual upload)
3. **Watch automatic deployment** in DigitalOcean dashboard
4. **Verify live updates** at your production URL
