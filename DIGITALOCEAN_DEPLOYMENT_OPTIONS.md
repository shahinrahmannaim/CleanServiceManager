# DigitalOcean Deployment: App Platform vs Droplets

## No Droplet Required for App Platform

**App Platform is serverless** - you don't create or manage droplets.

## Two Different DigitalOcean Options

### Option 1: App Platform (Recommended for You)
**No droplet creation needed:**
- Managed hosting service

- Built-in SSL and monitoring
- Database integration included
- Zero server management

**How it works:**
1. Go to DigitalOcean App Platform
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure settings (automatic)
4. Deploy - no servers to manage

### Option 2: Droplet (Traditional VPS)
**Requires manual droplet setup:**
